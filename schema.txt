BusManager API Schema
We have 3 Primary Sections:

	-> Admin (UI Based)
	-> Driver API
		Everything Relating to the Driver App
	-> Student API
		Everything Relating to the Student App
	-> main -> Other Routes

Admin
	baseroute: /admin

	-> Mark Payment Status
		Works based on the is_paid boolean property of each Student
		Every 30 days, is_paid becomes false.
		Then the student needs to pay the admin via their registered mobile number
		Every Unpaid user is seen in this Mark Payment Status and once the admin recieves 
		payment from a number, the admin can search the student using his number and Mark
		them as paid. this sets their is_paid to true.

	-> Journey Information
		This gives a list of all Drivers and shows how many students are travelling in that 
		particular driver's bus that day.

	-> Verify Drivers
		At Registration time, the phone number is verified via an OTP. 
		But, Until the driver's license and bus number have been verified, their account is marked
		as unverified. Once the admin is able to verify this information, the admin can search using
		phone number and mark that driver as verified
	
	-> Delete Driver
		Search by number and permanantly delete Driver

	-> Delete Student
		Search by number and permanantly delete student

	-> Reallocate Student ID
		Every 30 days student's is_paid is set to false.
		Every 180days (6months) the student account gets lapsed. and appears in this section of the
		admin panel.
		After the admin confirms the 25$ downpayment after 6 months, then the admin can search via number
		and press the reallocate button
		This basically sets is_paid to true and gives the student a new student ID
